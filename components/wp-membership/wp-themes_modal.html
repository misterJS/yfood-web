              Are the lines blurring between virtual and reality? Did the pandemic just fast forward us into Ready Player 1? Okay, not quite, however, it’s definitely catapulted us that bit closer: merging our digital worlds into our physical worlds even more. For the gaming generation, they are already one and the same! For the rest of us, the average smartphone user, we can’t deny we’re giving more time and importance to connecting, engaging and now it would even seem contributing digitally. Our expectations, for both our real-world and digital world selves, are growing in terms of what we can be part of, achieve, experience and of course have delivered!

        <p class="modal-desc">
          Given food is so physical in nature, what does this mean for us as an industry? How do we connect our physical food worlds to our new digital ones? Where are the opportunities and what new business models will create the new generation of game-changers? Can we motivate a community with NFTs? Is the timing right to explore the opportunity for experience, interaction and engagement for the food industry in the metaverse? How will people be ordering and purchasing food going forward? How do you manage your customer experience and interactions across multiple channels? What are the technologies and innovations that will help ease this additional pressure we’re facing as an industry? The world is changing, but how do we Connect: Now?
        </p>
        <p class="modal-desc">
          We’ll be exploring the tech, trends, innovations and visions that are set to change the way we “CONNECT: NOW” in the food ecosystem: Multi-channel disruption 2.0, next level digital communities (web3, NFT, crypto, digital real estate, the metaverse) , d2c, digital experience, virtual experience and worlds, experience economy @home, the role of social commerce, virtual kitchens, voice technology, reality technologies, automation, robotics, frictionless, ai, delivery, click and collect, the rise in expectation of quality, smart homes and technologies and more.

              It’s certainly been a challenging 2+ years and we’re not done yet! Whether your physical, mental, emotional or financial health have been impacted, there’s very few of us that have made it through completely unscathed. The impact of the pandemic has forced a spotlight on health worldwide, including on the vulnerability created from underlying health conditions. With millions suffering from Long Covid, the need for research into the link between food and health has never been more important, especially given early stage studies are already showing that Vitamin D, B12, Gut Health and Obesity all have their part to play risk factor and recovery. As well as the impact on our physical and neurological health, our mental health has clearly taken a severe hit too.

        <p class="modal-desc">
          We can definitely all agree it's time to…”REVIVE: ME!” Without a doubt, our healthcare systems and us (the food industry, its innovators and investors) all have critical roles to play in the process! Covid has forced us to bring the link between nutrition and health to the forefront (which is not a bad thing). So now more than ever it’s important for us to work side by side with our healthcare systems to create innovative solutions to all health concerns resulting in better well-being for us all.

              With a growing movement towards conscious consumption and an even more visible presence of activism on social media - everyone has a voice and you can be sure we’re all regularly using them! Every generation is now looking to the brands and companies that they love to take positive action towards restoring balance - be it environmental, equality, responsibility, ownership or a fairer approach to reward versus contribution. Each and everyone one of us wants them to “EMPOWER: US” to actively play our role.

              We all want to make better decisions and there’s nowhere more relevant or easy to do that than with food choices.

          Ultimately, everyone can vote with their forks. However, which decision should I be making? There’s a lot of information out there that can be confusing or conflicting: Should I cut plastic waste out altogether? But will that increase my food waste? What’s worse: plastic waste or food waste? We’re ready to be empowered to make better decisions around our food choices; be it through more information, scoring matrices, helpful reminders or nudging us in the right direction with informed alternatives.

            <p class="modal-desc">
              It’s no secret that the global population is not only growing but also urbanising and this will most certainly put increased pressure on the industry: The FAO actually estimates that farmers will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to meet the needs of the world’s growing population. We’re also more than aware that the food supply chain is responsible for c/26% of all man-made emissions and has multiple negative effects on the climate. Aside from the sustainability challenges and increasing pressures we’re facing, there’s a clear responsibility to make food both affordable and accessible.

        <p class="modal-desc">
          Globally, one in nine people are hungry or undernourished and in 2020 alone 2.37 billion people did not have access to enough safe and nutritious food, which is supposed to be a basic human right.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-desc">
          There is no doubt that as an industry we are most certainly facing some serious challenges in order to “FEED: EVERYONE” in both a sustainable and affordable way. We can no longer bury our heads in the sand, it’s time each and everyone of us took action and we certainly can’t get away with greenwashing!
          What will our farms and farming practices look like in the future? Should we be producing more locally? How can we improve our soil biodiversity?

        <p class="modal-desc">
          What will our farms and farming practices look like in the future? Should we be producing more locally? How can we improve our soil biodiversity? Is science and new farming solutions the answer or are there better farming practices that could help effect the change we need? How will we manage to feed a growing population whilst improving and ensuring food security? Can we really keep consuming all this meat? Are there better ways or practices that we should be adopting?
        </p>
        <p class="modal-desc">
          We’ll be exploring the tech, innovations and solutions, both on the farm and through creating new farms, that are shaping the way we’ll “FEED: EVERYONE” in the future. Helping us to create a more sustainable, efficient, commercially viable food production system that makes food accessible and affordable to everyone! It’s certainly a challenge, but one thing we know for sure is that technology, science and innovation have a critical role to play.
