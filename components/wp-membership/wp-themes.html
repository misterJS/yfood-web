        Are the lines blurring between virtual and reality? Our expectations, for both our real-world and digital world selves, are growing in terms of what we can be part of, achieve, experience and of course have delivered! Given food is so physical in nature, what does this mean for the industry? How do we connect our physical food worlds to our new digital ones?
        <br><br>
        We’ll be exploring the tech, trends, innovations and visions that are set to change the way we “CONNECT: NOW”:

        It’s certainly been a challenging 2+ years. Whether your physical, mental, emotional or financial health have been impacted, there’s very few of us that have made it through unscathed. So, with that being said we can definitely all agree it's time to…”REVIVE: ME!” Covid has forced us to bring the link between nutrition and health to the forefront. So now more than ever it’s important that we (the food industry, its innovators and investors) work side by side with our healthcare systems in creating new solutions to health concerns. 
        <br><br>
        We’ll be exploring the food ecosystem as it applies to all things health and wellness!

      <p class="upcoming-desc">
        With a growing movement towards conscious consumption and increased activism on social media - everyone has a voice and you can be sure we’re all regularly using them! We need to collectively make better decisions and there’s nowhere more relevant or easy to do that than with food choices. Ultimately, everyone can vote with their forks. 
        <br><br>
        This theme will explore the consumer trends and identities giving weight to prioritising “EMPOWERING: US”; the technologies, innovations and new form digital communities allowing us to reduce waste, improve our carbon footprint, as well as inform, empower and even nudge us in the right direction.

      <p class="upcoming-desc">
        It’s no secret that we are facing significant challenges in order to “FEED: EVERYONE” in a sustainable and affordable way. From population growth and urbanisation to the emissions we’re creating and our environmental impact through to the responsibility to make food accessible to everyone - it can all be incredibly overwhelming. One thing we know for sure is we need to collectively find solutions to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. 
        <br><br>
        We’ll be exploring the tech, innovations and solutions, both on the farm and through creating new farms, that are shaping the way we’ll “FEED: EVERYONE” in the future. Helping us to create a more sustainable, efficient, commercially viable food production system that makes food accessible and affordable to everyone!
